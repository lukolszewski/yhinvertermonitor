A simple script that fetches data from a Y&H invereter every second or so (via RS232 and modbus RTU) and pushes to a MQTT queue.

Some things are defined in the config.yaml, others in the code.

This is an early testing version.

Register data was used from here: https://github.com/odya/esphome-powmr-hybrid-inverter/blob/main/docs/registers-map.md

As well as extras defined in the docs folder.
